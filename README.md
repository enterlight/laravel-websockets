# Laravel WebSockets ðŸ›°

> [!NOTE]  
> The original Laravel WebSock is no longer maintained. It's a big problem for a lot of people.  Me included.  If you are looking for a PHP-based WebSocket solution, check out [Laravel Reverb](https://reverb.laravel.com) which is also built on top of ReactPHP and allows you to horizontally scale the WebSocket server.

> On my end, I am trying to make this one work, but I will not spend to much time on it
